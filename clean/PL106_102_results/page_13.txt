                                                                                                                            113 STAT. 1349

   "(A) IN GENERAL.—A depository institution controlled
by a financial holding company shall not—
        "(i) offer or market, directly or through any
arrangement, any product or service of a company
whose activities are conducted or whose shares are
owned or controlled by the financial holding company
pursuant to this subsection or subparagraph (H) or
(I) of subsection (k)(4); or
        "(ii) permit any of its products or services to be
offered or marketed, directly or through any arrange-
ment, by or through any company described in clause
(i).
   "(B) RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.—Subparagraph (A) shall
not be construed as prohibiting an arrangement between
a depository institution and a company owned or controlled
pursuant to subsection (k)(4)(I) for the marketing of prod-
ucts or services through statement inserts or Internet
websites if—
        "(i) such arrangement does not violate section 106
of the Bank Holding Company Act Amendments of
1970; and
        "(ii) the Board determines that the arrangement
is in the public interest, does not undermine the sepa-
ration of banking and commerce, and is consistent
with the safety and soundness of depository institu-
tions.
   "(6) TRANSACTIONS WITH NONFINANCIAL AFFILIATES.— A
depository institution controlled by a financial holding com-
pany may not engage in a covered transaction (as defined in section
23A(b)(7) of the Federal Reserve Act) with any affiliate con-
trolled by the company pursuant to this subsection.
   "(7) SUNSET OF GRANDFATHER.—A financial holding com-
pany engaged in any activity, or retaining direct or indirect
ownership or control of shares of a company, pursuant to this
subsection, shall terminate such activity and divest ownership
or control of the shares of such company before the end of
the 10-year period beginning on the date of the enactment
of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. The Board may, upon applica-
tion by a financial holding company, extend such 10-year period
by a period not to exceed an additional 5 years if such extension
would not be detrimental to the public interest.
   "(o) REGULATION OF CERTAIN FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPA-
NIES.—Notwithstanding subsection (a), a company that is not a
bank holding company or a foreign bank (as defined in section
1(b)(7) of the International Banking Act of 1978) and becomes
a financial holding company after the date of enactment of the
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, may continue to engage in, or directly
or indirectly own or control shares of a company engaged in, activi-
ties related to the trading, sale, or investment in commodities
and underlying physical properties that were not permissible for
bank holding companies to conduct in the United States as of
September 30, 1997, if—
        "(1) the holding company, or any subsidiary of the holding
company, lawfully was engaged, directly or indirectly, in any
of such activities as of September 30, 1997, in the United
States;
