"(1) USE OF AMOUNTS.—Amounts provided under this section (other than under subsection (b)) may be used only for mitigation activities specified in a mitigation plan approved by the Director under subsection (d). The Director shall provide assistance under this section to the extent amounts are available in the National Flood Mitigation Fund pursuant to appropriation Acts, subject only to the absence of approvable mitigation plans.
"(2) DETERMINATION OF ELIGIBLE PLANS.—The Director may approve only mitigation plans that specify mitigation activities that the Director determines are technically feasible and cost-effective and only such plans that propose activities that are cost-beneficial to the National Flood Mitigation Fund.

"(D) minor physical mitigation efforts that do not duplicate the flood prevention activities of other Federal agencies and that lessen the frequency or severity of flooding and decrease predicted flood damages, which shall not include major flood control projects such as dikes, levees, seawalls, groins, and jetties unless the Director specifically determines in approving a mitigation plan that such activities are the most cost-effective mitigation activities for the National Flood Mitigation Fund;
