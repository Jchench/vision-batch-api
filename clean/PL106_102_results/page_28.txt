“(II) the systems for monitoring and control-
     ling such risks; and
“(iii) to monitor compliance with the provisions 
     of this Act or any other Federal law that the Board 
     has specific jurisdiction to enforce against such com-
     pany or subsidiary and those governing transactions 
     and relationships between any depository institution 
     subsidiary and its affiliates.
“(B) FUNCTIONALLY REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES.—Not-
     withstanding subparagraph (A), the Board may make 
     examinations of a functionally regulated subsidiary of a 
     bank holding company only if—
“(i) the Board has reasonable cause to believe that
     such subsidiary is engaged in activities that pose a 
     material risk to an affiliated depository institution;
“(ii) the Board reasonably determines, after 
     reviewing relevant reports, that examination of the 
     subsidiary is necessary to adequately inform the Board 
     of the systems described in subparagraph (A)(ii)(II); 
     or
“(iii) based on reports and other available informa-
     tion, the Board has reasonable cause to believe that 
     a subsidiary is not in compliance with this Act or 
     any other Federal law that the Board has specific 
     jurisdiction to enforce against such subsidiary, 
     including provisions relating to transactions with an 
     affiliated depository institution, and the Board cannot 
     make such determination through examination of the 
     affiliated depository institution or the bank holding 
     company.
“(C) RESTRICTED FOCUS OF EXAMINATIONS.—The Board 
     shall, to the fullest extent possible, limit the focus and 
     scope of any examination of a bank holding company to—
“(i) the bank holding company; and
“(ii) any subsidiary of the bank holding company 
     that could have a materially adverse effect on the 
     safety and soundness of any depository institution sub-
     sidiary of the holding company due to—
“(I) the size, condition, or activities of the sub-
     sidiary; or
“(II) the nature or size of transactions between 
     the subsidiary and any depository institution that 
     is also a subsidiary of the bank holding company.
“(D) DEFERENCE TO BANK EXAMINATIONS.—The Board 
     shall, to the fullest extent possible, for the purposes of 
     this paragraph, use the reports of examinations of deposi-
     tory institutions made by the appropriate Federal and State 
     depository institution supervisory authority.
“(E) DEFERENCE TO OTHER EXAMINATIONS.—The Board 
     shall, to the fullest extent possible, forego an examination 
     by the Board under this paragraph and instead review 
     the reports of examination made of—
“(i) any registered broker or dealer by or on behalf 
     of the Securities and Exchange Commission; or
“(ii) any registered investment adviser properly 
     registered by or on behalf of either the Securities and 
     Exchange Commission or any State;
