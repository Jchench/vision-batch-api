tices or violations for the purpose of securing the correction thereof. Unless such correction shall be made within one hundred and twenty days or such shorter period of time as the Comptroller of the Currency, the State authority, or Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, as the case may be, shall require, the board of directors, if it shall determine to proceed further, shall give to the bank not less than thirty days’ written notice of intention to terminate the status of the bank as an insured bank, and shall fix a time and place for a hearing before the board of directors or before a person designated by it to conduct such hearing, at which evidence may be produced, and upon such evidence the board of directors shall make written findings which shall be conclusive. Unless the bank shall appear at the hearing by a duly authorized representative, it shall be deemed to have consented to the termination of its status as an insured bank. If the board of directors shall find that any violation specified in such notice has been established, the board of directors may order that the insured status of the bank be terminated on a date subsequent to such finding and to the expiration of the time specified in such notice of intention. The Corporation may publish notice of such termination and the bank shall give notice of such termination to each of its depositors at his last address of record on the books of the bank, in such manner and at such time as the board of directors may find to be necessary and may order for the protection of depositors. After the termination of the insured status of any bank under the provisions of this paragraph, the insured deposits of each depositor in the bank on the date of such termination, less all subsequent withdrawals from any deposits of such depositor, shall continue for a period of two years to be insured, and the bank shall continue to pay to the Corporation assessments as in the case of an insured bank during such period. No additions to any such deposits and no new deposits in such bank made after the date of such termination shall be insured by the Corporation, and the bank shall not advertise or hold itself out as having insured deposits unless in the same connection it shall also state with equal prominence that such additions to deposits and new deposits made after such date are not so insured. Such bank shall, in all other respects, be subject to the duties and obligations of an insured bank for the period of two years from the date of such termination, and in the event that such bank shall be closed on account of inability to meet the demands of its depositors within such period of two years, the Corporation shall have the same powers and rights with respect to such bank as in case of an insured bank.

“(2) Whenever the insured status of a State member bank shall be terminated by action of the board of directors, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System shall terminate its membership in the Federal Reserve System in accordance with the provisions of section 9 of this Act, and whenever the insured status of a national member bank shall be so terminated the Comptroller of the Currency shall appoint a receiver for the bank, which shall be the Corporation whenever the bank shall be unable to meet the demands of its depositors. Whenever a member bank shall cease to be a member of the Federal Reserve System, its status as an insured bank shall,
