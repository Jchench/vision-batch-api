101 STAT. 558        PUBLIC LAW 100-86--AUG. 10, 1987

    "(f) CERTAIN COMPANIES NOT TREATED AS BANK HOLDING 
COMPANIES.-
    "(1) IN GENERAL--Except as provided in paragraph (9), any
company which--
        "(A) on March 5, 1987, controlled an institution which 
became a bank as a result of the enactment of the Competiti-
tive Equality Amendments of 1987; and 
        "(B) was not a bank holding company on the day before
the date of the enactment of the Competitive Equality
Amendments of 1987,
shall not be treated as a bank holding company for purposes of 
this Act solely by virtue of such company's control of such
institution. 
        "(2) LOSS OF EXEMPTION.--Paragraph (1) shall cease to apply to 
any company described in such paragraph if--
            "(A) such company directly or indirectly--
                "(i) acquires control of an additional bank or an 
insured institution (other than an insured institution
described in paragraph (10) of this subsection) after 
March 5, 1987; or
                "(ii) acquires control of more than 5 percent of the
shares or assets of an additional bank or an insured 
institution other than--
                    "(I) shares acquired in a bona fide fiduciary 
capacity;
                    "(II) shares held temporarily pursuant to an 
underwriting commitment in the normal course of 
an underwriting business;
                    "(III) shares held in an account solely for trading 
purposes;
                    "(IV) loans or other accounts receivable acquired
in the normal course of business; and 
                    "(V) shares or assets of an insured institution 
described in paragraph (10) of this subsection; or
            "(B) any bank subsidiary of such company fails to comply 
with the restrictions contained in paragraph (3)(B).
        "(3) LIMITATION ON BANKS CONTROLLED BY PARAGRAPH (1) 
COMPANIES.--
            "(A) FINDINGS.--The Congress finds that banks controlled 
by companies referred to in paragraph (1) may, because of 
relationships with affiliates, be involved in conflicts of in-
terest, concentration of resources, or other effects adverse 
to bank safety and soundness, and may also be able to
compete unfairly against banks controlled by bank holding 
companies by combining banking services with financial 
services not permissible for bank holding companies. The 
purpose of this paragraph is to minimize any such potential
adverse effects or inequities by temporarily restricting the
activities of banks controlled by companies referred to in 
paragraph (1) until such time as the Congress has enacted 
proposals to allow, with appropriate safeguards, all banks 
or bank holding companies to compete on a more equal
basis with banks controlled by companies referred to in
paragraph (1) or, alternatively, proposals to permanently 
restrict the activities of banks controlled by companies 
referred to in paragraph (1).
