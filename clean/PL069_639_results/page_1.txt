[H. R. 2]

An Act To further amend the national banking laws and the Federal Reserve Act, and for other purposes.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled, That the Act
entitled “An Act to provide for the consolidation of national
banking associations,” approved November 7, 1918, be amended by
adding at the end thereof a new section to read as follows:

“SEC. 3. That any bank incorporated under the laws of any State,
or any bank incorporated in the District of Columbia, may be
consolidated with a national banking association located in the
same county, city, town, or village under the charter of such
national banking association on such terms and conditions as may
be lawfully agreed upon by a majority of the board of directors of
each association or bank proposing to consolidate, and which agree-
ment shall be ratified and confirmed by the affirmative vote of the
shareholders of each such association or bank owning at least two-
thirds of its capital stock outstanding, or by a greater proportion
of such capital stock in the case of such State bank if the laws of
the State where the same is organized so require, at a meeting to
be held on the call of the directors after publishing notice of the
time, place, and object of the meeting for four consecutive weeks
in some newspaper of general circulation published in the place
where the said association or bank is situated, and in the legal
newspaper for the publication of legal notices or advertisements,
if any such paper has been designated by the rules of a court in
the county where such association or bank is situated, and if no
newspaper is published in the place, then in a paper of general
circulation published nearest thereto, unless such notice of meeting
is waived in writing by all stockholders of any such association
or bank, and after sending such notice to each shareholder of record
by registered mail at least ten days prior to said meeting, but any
additional notice shall be given to the shareholders of such State
bank which may be required by the laws of the State where the
same is organized. The capital stock of such consolidated association
shall not be less than that required under existing law for the
organization of a national banking association in the place in which
such consolidated association is located; and all the rights, franchises,
and interests of such State or District bank so consolidated, with a
national banking association in and to every species of property,
real, personal, and mixed, and choses in action thereto belonging,
shall be deemed to be transferred to and vested in such national
banking association into which it is consolidated without any deed
or other transfer, and the said consolidated national banking asso-
ciation shall hold and enjoy the same and all rights of property,
franchises, and interests including the right of succession as trustee,
executor, or in any other fiduciary capacity in the same manner and
to the same extent as was held and enjoyed by such State or District
