     "(4) PRIOR APPROVAL OF CERTAIN NEW ACTIVITIES REQUIRED.-

  considering any application under subparagraph (A) by any 
  savings and loan holding company or any subsidiary of any 
  such company which is not an insured institution, the 
  Corporation shall consider-- 
        "(i) whether the performance of the activity de-
  scribed in such application by the company or the 
  subsidiary can reasonably be expected to produce bene-
  fits to the public (such as greater convenience, in-
  creased competition, or gains in efficiency) that out-
  weigh possible adverse effects of such activity (such as 
  undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair 
  competition, conflicts of interest, or unsound financial 
  practices);
        "(ii) the managerial resources of the companies in-
  volved; and

  ing capital, of the companies involved.
     "(C) CORPORATION MAY DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN NEW AND 
  ONGOING ACTIVITIES.--III prescribing any regulation or 
  considering any application under this paragraph, the Cor-
  poration may differentiate between activities commenced 
  de novo and activities commenced by the acquisition, in 
  whole or in part, of a going concern.
     "(D) APPROVAL OR DISAPPROVAL BY ORDER.--The approval 
  or disapproval of any application under this paragraph by 
  the Corporation shall be made in an order issued by the 
  Corporation containing the reasons for such approval or 
  disapproval.
     "(5) GRACE PERIOD TO ACHIEVE COMPLIANCE.--If any insured 
  institution referred to in paragraph (3) fails to maintain the 
  status of such institution as a qualified thrift lender, the Cor-
  poration may allow, for good cause shown, any company which 
  controls such institution (or any subsidiary of such company 
  which is not an insured institution) up to 3 years to comply with 
  the limitations contained in paragraph (1)(C).
     "(6) SPECIAL PROVISIONS RELATING TO CERTAIN COMPANIES 
  AFFECTED BY 1987 AMENDMENTS.--
     "(A) EXCEPTION TO 2-YEAR GRACE PERIOD FOR ACHIEVING

  company which received approval under subsection (e) of 
  this section to acquire control of an insured institution 
  between March 5, 1987, and the date of the enactment of 
  the Competitive Equality Amendments of 1987 shall not 
  continue any business activity other than the activities 
  described in paragraph (2) after such date of enactment.
