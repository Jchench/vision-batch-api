Unless the capital stock of the new bank is sold or its assets are taken over and its liabilities are assumed by an insured bank as above provided within two years from the date of its organization, the Corporation shall wind up the affairs of such bank, after giving such notice, if any, as the Comptroller of the Currency may require, and shall certify to the Comptroller of the Currency the termination of the new bank. Thereafter the Corporation shall be liable for the obligations of such bank and shall be the owner of its assets. The provisions of sections 5220 and 5221 of the Revised Statutes (U.S.C., title 12, secs. 181 and 182) shall not apply to such new banks.

"(m.) (1) The Corporation as receiver of a closed national bank or District bank shall not be required to furnish bond and shall have the right to appoint an agent or agents to assist it in its duties as such receiver, and all fees, compensation, and expenses of liquidation and administration thereof shall be fixed by the Corporation, subject to the approval of the Comptroller of the Currency, and may be paid by it out of funds coming into its possession as such receiver. The Comptroller of the Currency is authorized and empowered to waive and relieve the Corporation from complying with any regulations of the Comptroller of the Currency with respect to receiverships where in his discretion such action is deemed advisable to simplify administration.

"(3) Except as otherwise prescribed by the board of directors, neither the Corporation nor such new bank or other insured bank shall be required to recognize as the owner of any portion of a deposit appearing on the records of the closed bank under a name other than that of the claimant, any person whose name or interest as such owner is not disclosed on the records of such closed bank as part owner of said deposit, if such recognition would increase the aggregate amount of the insured deposits in such closed bank.

"(4) The Corporation may withhold payment of such portion of the insured deposit of any depositor in a closed bank as may be required to provide for the payment of any liability of such depositor as a stockholder of the closed bank, or of any liability of such depositor to the closed bank or its receiver, which is not offset against a claim due from such bank, pending the determination and payment of such liability by such depositor or any other person liable therefor.

"(5) If, after the Corporation shall have given at least three months' notice to the depositor by mailing a copy thereof to his last known address appearing on the records of the closed bank, any depositor in the closed bank shall fail to claim his insured deposit from the Corporation within eighteen months after the appointment of the receiver for the closed bank, or shall fail within such period to claim or arrange to continue the transferred deposit with the new bank or with the other insured bank which assumes liability therefor, all rights of the depositor against the Corporation with
