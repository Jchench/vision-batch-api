94 STAT. 136

PUBLIC LAW 96-221—MAR. 31, 1980

such requirement is imposed during which the average amount of reserves required under paragraph (2) are less than the all amount of reserves which would be required during such period if the initial ratios specified in paragraph (2) were in effect.

"(5) RESERVES RELATED TO FOREIGN OBLIGATIONS OR ASSETS.—
Foreign branches, subsidiaries, and international banking facili-
ties of nonmember depository institutions shall maintain re- 
serves to the same extent required by the Board of foreign 
branches, subsidiaries, and international banking facilities of 
member banks. In addition to any reserves otherwise required to 
be maintained pursuant to this subsection, any depository insti- 
tution shall maintain reserves in such ratios as the Board may 
prescribe against—
"(A) net balances owed by domestic offices of such deposi- 
tory institution in the United States to its directly related 
foreign offices and to foreign offices of nonrelated depository 
institutions;
"(B) loans to United States residents made by overseas 
offices of such depository institution if such depository 
institution has one or more offices in the United States; and 
"(C) assets (including participations) held by foreign offices 
of a depository institution in the United States which were 
acquired from its domestic offices.
    
"(6) EXEMPTION FOR CERTAIN DEPOSITS.—The requirements im- 
posed under paragraph (2) shall not apply to deposits payable 
only outside the States of the United States and the District of 
Columbia, except that nothing in this subsection limits the 
authority of the Board to impose conditions and requirements on 
member banks under section 25 of this Act or the authority of the 
Board under section 7 of the International Banking Act of 1978 
(12 U.S.C. 3105).
    
"(7) DISCOUNT AND BORROWING.—Any depository institution in 
which transaction accounts or nonpersonal time deposits are 
held shall be entitled to the same discount and borrowing 
privileges as member banks. In the administration of discount 
and borrowing privileges, the Board and the Federal Reserve 
banks shall take into consideration the special needs of savings 
and other depository institutions for access to discount and 
borrowing facilities consistent with their long-term asset portfo- 
lios and the sensitivity of such institutions to trends in the 
national money markets.
    
"(8) TRANSITIONAL ADJUSTMENTS.—
"(A) Any depository institution required to maintain re-
serves under this subsection which was engaged in business 
on July 1, 1979, but was not a member of the Federal Reserve 
System on or after that date, shall maintain reserves against 
its deposits during the first twelve-month period following 
the effective date of this paragraph in amounts equal to one- 
eighth of those otherwise required by this subsection, during 
the second such twelve-month period in amounts equal to 
one-fourth of those otherwise required, during the third such
twelve-month period in amounts equal to three-eighths of 
those otherwise required, during the fourth twelve-month 
period in amounts equal to one-half of those otherwise 
required, and during the fifth twelve-month period in 
amounts equal to five-eighths of those otherwise required, 
during the sixth twelve-month period in amounts equal to 
three-fourths of those otherwise required, and during the
