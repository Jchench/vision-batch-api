“(8) Should any national member bank or any insured national nonmember bank fail to file any certified statement required to be filed by such bank under any provision of this subsection, or fail to pay any assessment required to be paid by such bank under any provision of this section, and should the bank not correct such failure within thirty days after written notice has been given by the Corporation to an officer of the bank, citing this paragraph, and stating that the bank has failed to file or pay as required by law, all the rights, privileges, and franchises of the bank granted to it under the National Bank Act or under the provisions of this Act, as amended, shall be thereby forfeited.
