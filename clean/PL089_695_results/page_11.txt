In the event of the termination of insurance of accounts as herein provided the institution which was the insured institution shall give prompt and reasonable notice to all of its insured members that it has ceased to be an insured institution and it may include in such notice the fact that insured accounts, to the extent not withdrawn, repurchased, or redeemed, remain insured for two years from the date of such termination, but it shall not further represent itself in any manner as an insured institution.

"(e)  CEASE-AND-DESIST PROCEEDINGS.— (1) If, in the opinion of the Corporation, any insured institution or any institution any of the accounts of which are insured is engaging or has engaged, or the Corporation has reasonable cause to believe that the institution is about to engage, in an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting the business of such institution, or is violating or has violated, or the Corporation has reasonable cause to believe that the institution is about to violate, a law, rule, or regulation, or any condition imposed in writing by the Corporation in connection with the granting of any application or other request by the institution, or written agreement entered into with the Corporation, including any agreement entered into under section 403 of this title, the Corporation may issue and serve upon the institution a notice of charges in respect thereof. The notice shall contain a statement of the facts constituting the alleged violation or violations or the unsafe or unsound practice or practices, and shall fix a time and place at which a hearing will be held to determine whether an order to cease and desist therefrom should issue against the institution. Such hearing shall be fixed for a date not earlier than thirty days not later than sixty days after service of such notice unless an earlier or a later date is set by the Corporation at the request of the institution. Unless the institution shall appear at the hearing by a duly authorized representative, it shall be deemed to have consented to the issuance of the cease-and-desist order. In the event of such consent, or if upon the record made at any such hearing the Corporation shall find that any violation or unsafe or unsound practice specified in the notice of charges has been established, the Corporation may issue and serve upon the institution an order to cease and desist from any such violation or practice. Such order may, by provisions which may be mandatory or otherwise, require the institution and its directors, officers, employees, and agents to cease and desist from the same, and, further to take affirmative action to correct the conditions resulting from any such violation or practice.
