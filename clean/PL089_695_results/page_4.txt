“(B) Whenever, in the opinion of the Board, any director or officer of an association, by conduct or practice with respect to another savings and loan association or other business institution which resulted in substantial financial loss or other damage, has evidenced his personal dishonesty and unfitness to continue as a director or officer, and, whenever, in the opinion of the Board, any other person participating in the conduct of the affairs of an association, by conduct or practice with respect to such association or other savings and loan association or other business institution which resulted in substantial financial loss or other damage, has evidenced his personal dishonesty and unfitness to participate in the conduct of the affairs of such association, the Board may serve upon such director, officer, or other person a written notice of its intention to remove him from office and/or to prohibit his further participation in any manner in the conduct of the affairs of such association.

“(C) In respect to any director or officer of an association or any other person referred to in subparagraph (A) or (B) of this paragraph, the Board may, if it deems it necessary for the protection of the association or the interests of its savings account holders, by written notice to such effect served upon such director, officer, or other person, suspend him from office and/or prohibit him from further participation in any manner in the conduct of the affairs of the association. Such suspension and/or prohibition shall become effective upon service of such notice and, unless stayed by a court in proceedings authorized by subparagraph (E) of this paragraph, shall remain in effect pending the completion of the administrative proceedings pursuant to the notice served under subparagraph (A) or (B) of this paragraph and until such time as the Board shall dismiss the charges specified in such notice, or, if an order of removal and/or prohibition is issued against the director or officer or other person, until the effective date of any such order. Copies of any such notice shall also be served upon the association of which he is a director or officer or in the conduct of whose affairs he has participated.

“(D) A notice of intention to remove a director, officer, or other person from office and/or to prohibit his participation in the conduct of the affairs of an association, shall contain a statement of the facts constituting grounds therefor, and shall fix a time and place at which a hearing will be held thereon. Such hearing shall be fixed for a date not earlier than thirty days nor later than sixty days after the date of service of such notice, unless an earlier or a later date is set by the Board at the request of (i) such director, officer, or other person, and for good cause shown, or (ii) the Attorney General of the United States. Unless such director, officer, or other person shall appear at the hearing in person or by a duly authorized representative, he shall be deemed to have consented to the issuance of an order of such removal and/or prohibition. In the event of such consent, or if upon the record made at any such hearing the Board shall find that any of the grounds specified in such notice has been established, the Board may issue such orders of suspension or removal from office, and/or prohibition from participation in the conduct of the affairs of the association, as it may deem appropriate. Any such order shall become effective at the expiration of thirty days after service upon such association and the director, officer, or other person concerned (excepting in the case of an order issued upon consent, which shall become effective at the time specified therein). Such order shall remain effective and enforceable except to such extent as it is stayed, modified, terminated, or set aside by action of the Board or a reviewing court.
