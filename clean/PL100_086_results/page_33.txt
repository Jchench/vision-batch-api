                              Nothing in section 201 may be construed to prevent a Federal

                         to its legal authority in existence on the day preceding the date of
                         enactment of this Act to expand the securities, insurance, or real estate powers of banks or bank holding companies that are subject
                         to the moratorium established under section 201 if the effective date
                         of such rule, regulation, or order is delayed until the expiration of
12 USC 1841             such moratorium.
