subject to the real property loan, during the period beginning on the date a State adopted a constitutional provision or statute prohibit­ ing the exercise of due-on-sale clauses, or the date on which the highest court of such State has rendered a decision (or if the highest court has not so decided, the date on which the next highest appellate court has rendered a decision resulting in a final judgment if such decision applies State-wide) prohibiting such exercise, and ending on the date of enactment of this section, the provisions of subsection (b) shall apply only in the case of a transfer which occurs on or after the expiration of 3 years after the date of enactment of this Act, except that—
 (A) a State, by a State law enacted by the State legislature prior to the close of such 3-year period, with respect to real property loans originated in the State by lenders other than national banks, Federal savings and loan associations, Federal savings banks, and Federal credit unions, may otherwise regu­ late such contracts, in which case subsection (b) shall apply only if such State law so provides; and
 (B) the Comptroller of the Currency with respect to real property loans originated by national banks or the National Credit Union Administration Board with respect to real prop­ erty loans originated by Federal credit unions may, by regula­tion prescribed prior to the close of such period, otherwise regulate such contracts, in which case subsection (b) shall apply only if such regulation so provides.
