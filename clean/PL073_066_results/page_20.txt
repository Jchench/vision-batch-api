One-half of such payment shall be paid in full at the time of the admission of such member to the Fund, and the remainder of such payment shall be subject to call from time to time by the board of directors of the Corporation. Within a reasonable time fixed by the Corporation each such member shall file a similar statement showing, as of June 15, 1934, the number of its depositors and the total amount of its deposits which are eligible for such insurance and shall pay to the Corporation in the same manner an amount equal to one-half of 1 per centum of the increase, if any, in the total amount of such deposits since the date covered by the statement filed upon its admission to membership in the fund.

"If at any time prior to July 1, 1934, the Corporation requires additional funds with which to meet its obligations under this subsection, each member of the Fund shall be subject to one additional assessment only in an amount not exceeding the total amount theretofore paid to the Corporation by such member.
