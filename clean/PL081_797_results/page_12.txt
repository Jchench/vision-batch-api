"(c) For the purpose of any hearing under this Act, the Board of Directors, any member thereof or any person designated by the Board of Directors to conduct any such hearing, is empowered to administer oaths and affirmations, subpena any officer or employee of the insured bank, compel his attendance, take evidence, take depositions and require the production of any books, records, or other papers of the insured bank which are relevant or material to the inquiry. For the purpose of any hearing, examination, or investigation under this Act, the Board of Directors may apply to any judge or clerk of any court of the United States within the jurisdiction of which such hearing, examination, or investigation is carried on, or where such person resides or carries on business, to issue a subpena commanding each person to whom it is directed to attend and give testimony or for the taking of his deposition and to produce books, records, or other papers relevant or material to such hearing, examination, or investigation at a time and place and before a person therein specified. Such attendance of witnesses and the production of any such papers may be required from any place in any State or in any Territory or other place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States at any designated place where such a hearing is being held or such examination or investigation is being made: Provided, however, That the production of a person's documents at any place other than his place of business shall not be required in any case in which, prior to the return date specified in the subpena with respect thereto, such person either has furnished as directed a copy of such documents (certified by such person under oath to be a true and correct copy) or has entered into a stipulation with any authorized representative of the Corporation as to the information contained in such documents. Witnesses subpenaed under this section shall be paid the same fees and mileage that are paid witnesses in the district courts of the United States.

"(d) In cases of refusal to obey a subpena issued to, or contumacy by, any person, the Board of Directors may invoke the aid of any court of the United States within the jurisdiction of which such hearing, examination or investigation is carried on, or where such person resides or carries on business, in requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of books, records, or other papers. And such court may issue an order requiring such person to appear before the Board of Directors or member or person designated by the Board of Directors, there to produce records, if so ordered, or to give testimony touching the matter in question; and any failure to obey such order of the court may be punished by such court as a contempt thereof. All process in any such case may be served in the judicial district whereof such person is an inhabitant or carries on business or wherever he may be found. No person shall be excused from attending and testifying or from producing books, records, or other papers in obedience to a subpena issued under the authority of this Act on the ground that the testimony or evidence, documentary or otherwise, required of him may tend to incriminate him or subject him to penalty or forfeiture; but no individual shall be prosecuted or subject to any penalty or forfeiture for or on account of any transaction, matter, or thing concerning which he is compelled to testify, or produce evidence, documentary or otherwise, after having claimed his privilege against self-incrimination, except that such individual
