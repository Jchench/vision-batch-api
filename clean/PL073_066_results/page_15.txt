perform temporarily the functions provided for in this subsection. Upon satisfactory recognition of the right of the Corporation to receive dividends on the same basis as in the case of a closed national bank under this subsection, such recognition being accorded by State law, by allowance of claims by the appropriate State authority, by assignment of claims by depositors, or by any other effective method, the Corporation shall make available to such new national bank, in the manner prescribed by this subsection, an amount equal to the insured deposit liabilities of such closed State member bank; and the Corporation and such new national bank shall perform all of the functions and duties and shall have all the rights and privileges with respect to such State member bank and the depositors thereof which are prescribed by this subsection with respect to closed national banks holding class A stock in the Corporation: Provided, That the rights of depositors and other creditors of such State member bank shall be determined in accordance with the applicable provisions of State law: And provided further, That, with respect to such State member bank, the Corporation shall possess the powers and privileges provided by State law with respect to a receiver of such State member bank, except in so far as the same are in conflict with the provisions of this subsection.
    â€œWhenever any State member bank which is a class A stockholder of the Corporation shall have been closed by action of its board of directors or by the appropriate State authority, as the case may be, on account of inability to meet the demands of its depositors, and the applicable State law does not permit the appointment of the Corporation as receiver of such bank, the Corporation shall organize a new national bank, in accordance with the provisions of this subsection, to assume the insured deposit liabilities of such closed State member bank, to receive new deposits, and otherwise to perform temporarily the functions provided for in this subsection. Upon satisfactory recognition of the right of the Corporation to receive dividends on the same basis as in the case of a closed national bank under this subsection, such recognition being accorded by State law, by allowance of claims by the appropriate State authority, by assignment of claims by depositors, or by any other effective method, the Corporation shall make available to such new bank, in accordance with the provisions of this subsection, the amount of insured deposit liabilities as to which such recognition has been accorded; and such new bank shall assume such insured deposit liabilities and shall in other respects comply with the provisions of this subsection respecting new banks organized to assume insured deposit liabilities of closed national banks. In so far as possible in view of the applicable provisions of State law, the Corporation shall proceed with respect to the receiver of such closed bank and with respect to the new bank organized to assume its insured deposit liabilities in the manner prescribed by this subsection with respect to closed national banks and new banks organized to assume their insured deposit liabilities; except that the Corporation shall have none of the powers, duties, or responsibilities of a receiver with respect to the winding up of the affairs of such closed State member bank. The Corporation, in its discretion, however, may purchase and liquidate any or all of the assets of such bank.
