            following:
                                "(a) REQUIREMENT FOR PARTICIPATION IN FLOOD INSURANCE

                                    "(1) IN GENERAL.—After December"; and 
                           (2) by adding at the end the following new subsection:
                                "(b) COMMUNITY RATING SYSTEM AND INCENTIVES FOR COMMU-
            NITY FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT.—
                                    "(1) AUTHORITY AND GOALS.—The Director shall carry out 
                      a community rating system program, under which communities 
                      participate voluntarily—
                                                    "(A) to provide incentives for measures that reduce 
                                the risk of flood or erosion damage that exceed the criteria 
                                set forth in section 1361 and evaluate such measures;
                                                    "(B) to encourage adoption of more effective measures 
                                that protect natural and beneficial floodplain functions;
                                                    "(C) to encourage floodplain and erosion management; 
                                and
                                                    "(D) to promote the reduction of Federal flood insurance 
                                 losses.
                                    "(2) INCENTIVES.—The program shall provide incentives in 
                      the form of credits on premium rates for flood insurance cov-
                      erage in communities that the Director determines have 
                      adopted and enforced measures that reduce the risk of flood 
                      and erosion damage that exceed the criteria set forth in section 
                      1361. In providing incentives under this paragraph, the Director 
                      may provide for credits to flood insurance premium rates in 
                      communities that the Director determines have implemented 
                      measures that protect natural and beneficial floodplain 
                      functions.
                                    "(3) CREDITS.—The credits on premium rates for flood 
                      insurance coverage shall be based on the estimated reduction 
                      in flood and erosion damage risks resulting from the measures 
                      adopted by the community under this program. If a community 
                      has received mitigation assistance under section 1366, the cred-
                      its shall be phased in a manner, determined by the Director, 
                      to recover the amount of such assistance provided for the 
                      community.
                                    "(4) REPORTS.—Not later than 2 years after the date of 
                      enactment of the Riegle Community Development and Regu-
                      latory Improvement Act of 1994 and not less than every 2 
                      years thereafter, the Director shall submit a report to the 
                      Congress regarding the program under this subsection. Each 
                      report shall include an analysis of the cost-effectiveness of
