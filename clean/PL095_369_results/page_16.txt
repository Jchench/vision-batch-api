SEC. 8. (a) Except as otherwise provided in this section (1) any foreign bank that maintains a branch or agency in a State, (2) any foreign bank or foreign company controlling a foreign bank that controls a commercial lending company organized under State law, and (3) any company of which any foreign bank or company referred to in (1) and (2) is a subsidiary shall be subject to the provisions of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, and to sections 105 and 106 of the Bank Holding Company Act Amendments of 1970 in the same manner and to the same extent that bank holding companies are subject thereto, except that any such foreign bank or company shall not by reason of this subsection be deemed a bank holding company for purposes of section 3 of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956.

(b) Until December 31, 1985, a foreign bank or other company to which subsection (a) applies on the date of enactment of this Act may retain direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any nonbanking company in the United States that it owned, controlled, or held with power to vote on the date of enactment of this Act or engage in any nonbanking activities in the United States in which it was engaged on such date.

(c) After December 31, 1985, a foreign bank or other company to which subsection (a) applies on the date of enactment of this Act may continue to engage in nonbanking activities in the United States in which directly or through an affiliate it was lawfully engaged on July 26, 1978 (or on a date subsequent to July 26, 1978, in the case of activities carried on as the result of the direct or indirect acquisition, pursuant to a binding written contract entered into on or before July 26, 1978, of another company engaged in such activities at the time of acquisition), and may engage directly or through an affiliate in nonbanking activities in the United States which are covered by an application to engage in such activities which was filed on or before July 26, 1978; except that the Board by order, after opportunity for hearing, may terminate the authority conferred by this subsection (c) on any such foreign bank or company to engage directly or through an affiliate in any activity otherwise permitted by this subsection (c) if it determines having due regard for the purposes of this Act and the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, that such action is necessary to prevent undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest, or unsound banking practices in the United States. Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a foreign bank or company referred to in this subsection (c) may retain ownership or control of any voting shares (or, where necessary to prevent dilution of its voting interest, acquire additional voting shares) of any domestically-controlled affiliate covered in 1978 which engages in the business of underwriting, distributing, or otherwise buying or selling stocks, bonds, and other securities in the United States. Except in the case of affiliates described in the preceding sentence, nothing in this subsection (c) shall be construed to authorize any foreign bank or company referred to in this subsection (c), or any affiliate thereof, to engage in activities authorized by this subsection (c) through the acquisition, pursuant to a contract entered into after July 26, 1978, of any interest in or the assets of a going concern engaged in such activities.
