(C) proof that the producer is licensed and in good standing in its home State; and  
(D) the payment of any requisite fee to the appropriate authority.  
(2) CONTINUING EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS.—A majority of the States accept an insurance producer’s satisfaction of its home State’s continuing education requirements for licensed insurance producers to satisfy the States’ own continuing education requirements if the producer’s home State also recognizes the satisfaction of continuing education requirements on such a reciprocal basis.  
(3) NO LIMITING NONRESIDENT REQUIREMENTS.—A majority of the States do not impose any requirement upon any insurance producer to be licensed or otherwise qualified to do business as a nonresident that has the effect of limiting or conditioning that producer’s activities because of its residence or place of operations, except that countersignature requirements imposed on nonresident producers shall not be deemed to have the effect of limiting or conditioning a producer’s activities because of its residence or place of operations under this section.  
(4) RECIPROCAL RECIPROCITY.—Each of the States that satisfies paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) grants reciprocity to residents of all of the other States that satisfy such paragraphs.

(1) NAIC DETERMINATION.—At the end of the 3-year period beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (hereafter in this subtitle referred to as the “NAIC”) shall determine, in consultation with the insurance commissioners or chief insurance regulatory officials of the States, whether the uniformity or reciprocity required by subsections (b) and (c) has been achieved.  
(2) JUDICIAL REVIEW.—The appropriate United States district court shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any challenge to the NAIC’s determination under this section and such court shall apply the standards set forth in section 706 of title 5, United States Code, when reviewing any such challenge.  
(e) CONTINUED APPLICATION.—If, at any time, the uniformity or reciprocity required by subsections (b) and (c) no longer exists, the provisions of this subtitle shall take effect 2 years after the date on which such uniformity or reciprocity ceases to exist, unless the uniformity or reciprocity required by those provisions is satisfied before the expiration of that 2-year period.  
(f) SAVINGS PROVISION.—No provision of this section shall be construed as requiring that any law, regulation, provision, or action of any State which purports to regulate insurance producers, including any such law, regulation, provision, or action which purports to regulate unfair trade practices or establish consumer protections, including counter signature laws, be altered or amended in order to satisfy the uniformity or reciprocity required by subsections (b) and (c), unless any such law, regulation, provision, or action is inconsistent with a specific requirement of any such subsection and then only to the extent of such inconsistency.  
(g) UNIFORM LICENSING.—Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any State to adopt new or additional licensing
