stockholder of the Corporation, no national bank in the continental 
United States shall be granted a certificate by the Comptroller of 
the Currency authorizing it to commence the business of banking 
until it becomes a member of the Federal Reserve System and a 
class A stockholder of the Corporation, and no national bank in 
the continental United States for which a receiver or conservator 
has been appointed shall be permitted to resume the transaction 
of its banking business until it becomes a class A stockholder of the 
Corporation. Every member bank shall apply to the Corporation 
for class A stock of the Corporation in an amount equal to one half 
of 1 per centum of its total deposit liabilities as computed in accord-
ance with regulations prescribed by the Federal Reserve Board; 
except that in the case of a member bank organized after the date this 
section takes effect, the amount of such class A stock applied for by 
such member bank during the first twelve months after its organiza-
tion shall equal 5 per centum of its paid-up capital and surplus, and 
beginning after the expiration of such twelve monthsâ€™ period the 
amount of such class A stock of such member bank shall be adjusted 
annually in the same manner as in the case of other member banks. 
Upon receipt of such application the Corporation shall request the 
Federal Reserve Board, in the case of a State member bank, or the 
Comptroller of the Currency, in the case of a national bank, to cer-
tify upon the basis of a thorough examination of such bank whether 
or not the assets of the applying bank are adequate to enable it to 
meet all of its liabilities to depositors and other creditors as shown 
by the books of the bank; and the Federal Reserve Board or the 
Comptroller of the Currency shall make such certification as soon as 
practicable. If such certification be in the affirmative, the Corpora-
tion shall grant such application and the applying bank shall pay one 
half of its subscription in full and shall thereupon become a class A 
stockholder of the Corporation: Provided, That no member bank 
shall be required to make such payment or become a class A stock-
holder of the Corporation before July 1, 1934. The remainder of 
such subscription shall be subject to call from time to time by the 
board of directors of the Corporation. If such certification be in the 
negative, the Corporation shall deny such application. If any 
national bank shall not have become a class A stockholder of the 
Corporation on or before July 1, 1934, the Comptroller of the Cur-
rency shall appoint a receiver or conservator therefor in accordance 
with the provisions of existing law. Except as provided in subsec-
tion (g) of this section, if any State member bank shall not have 
become a class A stockholder of the Corporation on or before July 1, 
1934, the Federal Reserve Board shall terminate its membership in 
the Federal Reserve System in accordance with the provisions of 
section 9 of this Act.
	(f) Any State bank or trust company or mutual savings bank 
which applies for membership in the Federal Reserve System or for 
conversion into a national banking association on or after July 1, 
1936, may, with the consent of the Corporation, obtain the benefits 
of this section, pending action on such application, by subscribing 
and paying for the same amount of stock of the Corporation as it 
would be required to subscribe and pay for upon becoming a member
