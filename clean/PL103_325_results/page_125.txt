        (C) the effects that the increased premium rates would have on land values and property taxes; and
        (D) any other effects that the increased premium rates would have on the economy and homeowners.

(c) REPORT.—The Director shall submit a report to the Congress describing and explaining the findings of the study conducted under this section. The report shall be submitted not later than 12 months after the date of enactment of this Act.
