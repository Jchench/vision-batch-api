for a full semiannual period ending on June 30 or December 31 as the case may be. Each such bank, on or before the forty-fifth day after its first day of operation as an insured bank, shall file with the Corporation its first certified statement which shall be under oath and shall show the amount of the assessment base determined in accordance with paragraph (1) of this subsection, except that the assessment base shall be the average for the first thirty-one calendar days it operates as an insured bank. Each such certified statement shall also show as the amount of the first assessment due to the Corporation the prorated portion (for the period between its first day of operation as an insured bank and the next succeeding last day of June or December, as the case may be) of an amount equal to the product of one-half the annual assessment rate multiplied by the base required to be set forth on its first certified statement. Each bank which becomes an insured bank after the effective date which has not operated as an insured bank for a full semiannual period ending on June 30 or December 31, as the case may be, shall, on or before the 15th day of the first month thereafter (except that banks becoming insured in June or December shall have thirty-one additional days) file with the Corporation its second certified statement under oath showing the amount of the assessment base and the amount of the semiannual assessment due to the Corporation. Such assessment base and amount shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (1) of this subsection, except that if the bank became an insured bank in the month of December or June the assessment base shall be the average for the first thirty-one calendar days it operates as an insured bank, and except that if it became an insured bank in any other month than December or June the assessment base shall be the average for the days between its first day of operation as an insured bank and the next succeeding last day of June or December, as the case may be. Each bank required to file a certified statement under this paragraph shall pay to the Corporation the amount of the assessment the bank is required to certify.

"(5) Each bank which shall be and continue without application or approval an insured bank in accordance with the provisions of subsection (e) or (f) of this section, shall, in lieu of all right to refund (except as authorized in paragraph (3) of subsection (i)), be credited with any balance to which such bank shall become entitled upon the termination of the said Temporary Federal Deposit Insurance Fund or the Fund For Mutuals. The credit shall be applied by the Corporation toward the payment of the assessment next becoming due from such bank and upon succeeding assessments until the credit is exhausted.

"(6) Any insured bank which fails to file any certified statement required to be filed by it in connection with determining the amount of any assessment payable by the bank to the Corporation may be compelled to file such statement by mandatory injunction or other appropriate remedy in a suit brought for such purpose by the Corporation against the bank and any officer or officers thereof in any court of the United States of competent jurisdiction in the district or territory in which such bank is located.

"(7) The Corporation, in a suit brought at law or in equity in any court of competent jurisdiction, shall be entitled to recover from any insured bank the amount of any unpaid assessment lawfully payable
