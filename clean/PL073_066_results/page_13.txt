For the purposes of this subsection, the term 'insured deposit liabilities' shall mean the aggregate amount of all such insured deposit liabilities of such closed bank. The Corporation shall determine as expeditiously as possible the net amounts due to depositors of the closed bank and shall make available to the new bank an amount equal to the insured deposit liabilities of such closed bank, whereupon such new bank shall assume the insured deposit liability of such closed bank to each of its depositors, and the Corporation shall be subrogated to all rights against the closed bank of the owners of such deposits and shall be entitled to receive the same dividends from the proceeds of the assets of such closed bank as would have been payable to each such depositor until such dividends shall equal the insured deposit liability to such depositor assumed by the new bank, whereupon all further dividends shall be payable to such depositor. Of the amount thus made available by the Corporation to the new bank, such portion shall be paid to it in cash as may be necessary to enable it to meet immediate cash demands and the remainder shall be credited to it on the books of the Corporation subject to withdrawal on demand and shall bear interest at the rate of 3 per centum per annum until withdrawn. The new bank may, with the approval of the Corporation, accept new deposits, which, together with all amounts made available to the new bank by the Corporation, shall be kept on hand in cash, invested in direct obligations of the United States, or deposited with the Corporation or with a Federal reserve bank. Such new bank shall maintain on deposit with the Federal reserve bank of its district the reserves required by law of member banks but shall not be required to subscribe for stock of the Federal reserve bank until its own capital stock has been subscribed and paid for in the manner hereinafter provided. The articles of association and organization certificate of such new bank may be executed by such representatives of the Corporation as it may designate; the new bank shall not be required to have any directors at the time of its organization, but shall be managed by an executive officer to be designated by the Corporation; and no capital stock need be paid in by the Corporation; but in other respects such bank shall be organized in accordance with the existing provisions of law relating to the organization of national banks; and, until the requisite amount of capital stock for such bank has been subscribed and paid for in the manner hereinafter provided, such bank shall transact no business except that authorized by this subsection and such business as may be incidental to its organization. When in the judgment of the Corporation it is desirable to do so, the Corporation shall offer capital stock of the new bank for sale on such terms and conditions as the Corporation shall deem advisable, in an amount sufficient in the opinion of the Corporation to make possible the conduct of the business of the new bank on a sound basis, but in no event less than that required by section 5138 of the Revised Statutes, as amended (U.S.C., title 12, sec. 51), for the organization of a national bank in the place where such new bank is located, giving the stockholders of the closed bank the first opportunity to purchase such stock. Upon proof that an adequate amount of capital stock of the new bank has been subscribed and paid for in cash by subscribers satisfactory to the Comptroller of the Currency, he shall issue to such bank a certificate
