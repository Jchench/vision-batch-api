(a) REVIEW AND REVISION OF REGULATIONS.—
      (1) IN GENERAL.—During the 180-day period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, each appropriate Federal banking agency shall, consistent with the principles of safety and soundness and the public interest—

          (A)  review the agency’s regulations and written policies relating to transfers of assets with recourse by insured depository institutions; and 
          (B)  in consultation with the other Federal banking agencies, promulgate regulations that better reflect the exposure of an insured depository institution to credit risk from transfers of assets with recourse.

      (2) EXCEPTION FOR SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS.—The appropriate Federal banking agency may require any insured depository institution to maintain risk-based capital in an amount greater than the amount determined under paragraph (1), if the agency determines, by regulation or order, that such higher amount is necessary for safety and soundness reasons.
