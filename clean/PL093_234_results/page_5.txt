EXTENSION OF FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM TO COVER LOSSES FROM EROSION AND UNDERMINING OF SHORELINES 

SEC. 108. (a) Section 1302 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 is amended by adding at the end thereof the following new subsection:
    “(g) The Congress also finds that (1) the damage and loss which may result from the erosion and undermining of shorelines by waves or currents in lakes and other bodies of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels is related in cause and similar in effect to that which results directly from storms, deluges, overflowing waters, and other forms of flooding, and (2) the problems involved in providing protection against this damage and loss, and the possibilities for making such protection available through a Federal or federally sponsored program, are similar to those which exist in connection with efforts to provide protection against damage and loss caused by such other forms of flooding. It is therefore the further purpose of this title to make available, by means of the methods, procedures, and instrumentalities which are otherwise established or available under this title for purposes of the flood insurance program, protection against damage and loss resulting from the erosion and undermining of shorelines by waves
