                                      FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF PURPOSE

SEC. 2. (a) The Congress finds that-
               (1) annual losses throughout the Nation from floods and mud- 
    slides are increasing at an alarming rate, largely as a result of 
    the accelerating development of, and concentration of population 
    in areas of flood and mudslide hazards; 
               (2) the availability of Federal loans, grants, guaranties,  
    insurance, and other forms of financial assistance are often 
    determining factors in the utilization of land and the location 
    and construction of public and of private industrial, commercial, 
    and residential facilities;
               (3) property acquired or constructed with grants or other 
    Federal assistance may be exposed to risk of loss through floods, 
    thus frustrating the purpose for which such assistance was 
    extended;
               (4) Federal instrumentalities insure or otherwise provide  
    financial protection to banking and credit institutions whose assets 
    include a substantial number of mortgage loans and other indebt-
    edness secured by property exposed to loss and damage from 
    floods and mudslides;
