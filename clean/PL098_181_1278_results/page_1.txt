12 USC 3901.                        Sec. 902. (a)(1) It is the policy of the Congress to assure that the
                                     economic health and stability of the United States and the other
                                     nations of the world shall not be adversely affected or threatened in
                                     the future by imprudent lending practices or inadequate
                                     supervision.
                                      (2) This shall be achieved by strengthening the bank regulatory
                                     framework to encourage prudent private decisionmaking and by
                                     enhancing international coordination among bank regulatory
                                     authorities.
                                        (b) The Federal banking agencies shall consult with the banking
                                     supervisory authorities of other countries to reach understandings
                                     aimed at achieving the adoption of effective and consistent supervi-
                                     sory policies and practices with respect to international lending.
