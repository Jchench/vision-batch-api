at the hearing by a duly authorized representative, it shall be deemed to have consented to the issuance of the cease-and-desist order. In the event of such consent, or if upon the record made at any such hearing, the agency shall find that any violation or unsafe or unsound practice specified in the notice of charges has been established, the agency may issue and serve upon the bank an order to cease and desist from any such violation or practice. Such order may, by provisions which may be mandatory or otherwise, require the bank and its directors, officers, employees, and agents to cease and desist from the same, and, further, to take affirmative action to correct the conditions resulting from any such violation or practice.
“(2) A cease-and-desist order shall become effective at the expiration of thirty days after the service of such order upon the bank concerned (except in the case of a cease-and-desist order issued upon consent, which shall become effective at the time specified therein), and shall remain effective and enforceable as provided therein, except to such extent as it is stayed, modified, terminated, or set aside by action of the agency or a reviewing court.
“(c) (1) Whenever the appropriate Federal banking agency shall determine that the violation or threatened violation or the unsafe or unsound practice or practices, specified in the notice of charges served upon the bank pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection (b) of this section, or the continuation thereof, is likely to cause insolvency or substantial dissipation of assets or earnings of the bank, or is likely to otherwise seriously prejudice the interests of its depositors, the agency may issue a temporary order requiring the bank to cease and desist from any such violation or practice. Such order shall become effective upon service upon the bank and, unless set aside, limited, or suspended by a court in proceedings authorized by paragraph (2) of this subsection, shall remain effective and enforceable pending the completion of the administrative proceedings pursuant to such notice and until such time as the agency shall dismiss the charges specified in such notice, or if a cease-and-desist order is issued against the bank, until the effective date of any such order.
   “(2) Within ten days after the bank concerned has been served with a temporary cease-and-desist order, the bank may apply to the United States district court for the judicial district in which the home office of the bank is located, or the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, for an injunction setting aside, limiting, or suspending the enforcement, operation, or effectiveness of such order pending the completion of the administrative proceedings pursuant to the notice of charges served upon the bank under paragraph (1) of subsection (b) of this section, and such court shall have jurisdiction to issue such injunction.
   “(d) In the case of violation or threatened violation of, or failure to obey, a temporary cease-and-desist order issued pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection (c) of this section, the appropriate Federal banking agency may apply to the United States district court, or the United States court of any territory, within the jurisdiction of which the home office of the bank is located, for an injunction to enforce such order, and, if the court shall determine that there has been such violation or threatened violation or failure to obey, it shall be the duty of the court to issue such injunction.
   “(e) (1) Whenever, in the opinion of the appropriate Federal banking agency, any director or officer of an insured State bank (other than a District bank) has committed any violation of law, rule, or regulation, or of a cease-and-desist order which has become final, or, has engaged or participated in any unsafe or unsound practice in connection with the bank, or has committed or engaged in any act, omis
