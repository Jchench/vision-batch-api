(d) Every officer, director, agent, and employee of every such holding company affiliate shall be subject to the same penalties for false entries in any book, report, or statement of such holding company affiliate as are applicable to officers, directors, agents, and employees of member banks under section 5209 of the Revised Statutes, as amended (U.S.C., title 12, sec. 592) ; and

(e) Every such holding company affiliate shall, in its application for such voting permit, (1) show that it does not own, control, or have any interest in, and is not participating in the management or direction of, any corporation, business trust, association, or other similar organization formed for the purpose of, or engaged principally in, the issue, flotation, underwriting, public sale, or distribution, at wholesale or retail or through syndicate participation, of stocks, bonds, debentures, notes, or other securities of any sort (hereinafter referred to as 'securities company') ; (2) agree that during the period that the permit remains in force it will not acquire any ownership, control, or interest in any such securities company or participate in the management or direction thereof; (3) agree that if, at the time of filing the application for such permit, it owns, controls, or has an interest in, or is participating in the management or direction of, any such securities company, it will, within five years after the filing of such application, divest itself of its ownership, control, and interest in such securities company and will cease participating in the management or direction thereof, and will not thereafter, during the period that the permit remains in force, acquire any further ownership, control, or interest in any such securities company or participate in the management or direction thereof; and (4) agree that thenceforth it will declare dividends only out of actual net earnings.

If at any time it shall appear to the Federal Reserve Board that any holding company affiliate has violated any of the provisions of the Banking Act of 1933 or of any agreement made pursuant to this section, the Federal Reserve Board may, in its discretion, revoke any such voting permit after giving sixty days' notice by registered mail of its intention to the holding company affiliate and affording it an opportunity to be heard. Whenever the Federal Reserve Board shall have revoked any such voting permit, no national bank whose stock is controlled by the holding company affiliate whose permit is so revoked shall receive deposits of public moneys of the United States, nor shall any such national bank pay any further dividend to such holding company affiliate upon any shares of such bank controlled by such holding company affiliate.
