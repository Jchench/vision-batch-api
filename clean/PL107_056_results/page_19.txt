‘‘(2) STATE INVESTIGATIVE OR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER.—
Upon an application made under section 3122(a)(2), the court
shall enter an ex parte order authorizing the installation and
use of a pen register or trap and trace device within the
jurisdiction of the court, if the court finds that the State law
enforcement or investigative officer has certified to the court
that the information likely to be obtained by such installation
and use is relevant to an ongoing criminal investigation.

‘‘(3)(A) Where the law enforcement agency implementing
an ex parte order under this subsection seeks to do so by
installing and using its own pen register or trap and trace
device on a packet-switched data network of a provider of
electronic communication service to the public, the agency shall
ensure that a record will be maintained which will identify—

‘‘(i) any officer or officers who installed the device
and any officer or officers who accessed the device to obtain
information from the network;

‘‘(ii) the date and time the device was installed, the
date and time the device was uninstalled, and the date,
time, and duration of each time the device is accessed
to obtain information;

‘‘(iii) the configuration of the device at the time of
its installation and any subsequent modification thereof;
and

‘‘(iv) any information which has been collected by the
device.

To the extent that the pen register or trap and trace device
can be set automatically to record this information electroni-
cally, the record shall be maintained electronically throughout
the installation and use of such device.

‘‘(B) The record maintained under subparagraph (A) shall
be provided ex parte and under seal to the court which entered
the ex parte order authorizing the installation and use of the
device within 30 days after termination of the order (including
any extensions thereof).’’.
