SEC. 201. SERVICER SAFE HARBOR FOR MORTGAGE LOAN MODIFICA-
                     TIONS.
    (a) CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following:
        (1) Increasing numbers of mortgage foreclosures are not 
    only depriving many Americans of their homes, but are also 
    destabilizing property values and negatively affecting State 
    and local economies as well as the national economy.
        (2) In order to reduce the number of foreclosures and 
    to stabilize property values, local economies, and the national 
    economy, servicers must be given—
            (A) authorization to—
                (i) modify mortgage loans and engage in other 
            loss mitigation activities consistent with applicable 
            guidelines issued by the Secretary of the Treasury 
            or his designee under the Emergency Economic Sta-
            bilization Act of 2008; and
                (ii) refinance mortgage loans under the Hope for 
            Homeowners program; and
            (B) a safe harbor to enable such servicers to exercise 
        these authorities.
    (b) SAFE HARBOR.—Section 129A of the Truth in Lending Act 
(15 U.S.C. 1639a) is amended to read as follows:

‘‘SEC. 129. DUTY OF SERVICERS OF RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES.
    ‘‘(a) IN GENERAL.—Notwithstanding any other provision of law, 
whenever a servicer of residential mortgages agrees to enter into 
a qualified loss mitigation plan with respect to 1 or more residential 
mortgages originated before the date of enactment of the Helping 
Families Save Their Homes Act of 2009, including mortgages held 
in a securitization or other investment vehicle—
        ‘‘(1) to the extent that the servicer owes a duty to investors 
    or other parties to maximize the net present value of such 
    mortgages, the duty shall be construed to apply to all such 
    investors and parties, and not to any individual party or group 
    of parties; and
