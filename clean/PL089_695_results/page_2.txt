ized to act in its own name and through its own attorneys. Except 
as otherwise provided herein, the Board shall be subject to suit (other 
than suits on claims for money damages by any Federal savings and 
loan association or director or officer thereof with respect to any 
matter under this section or any other applicable law, or rules or 
regulations thereunder, in the United States district court for the 
judicial district in which the home office of the association is located, 
or in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, 
and the Board may be served with process in the manner prescribed 
by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. 
"(2) (A) If, in the opinion of the Board, an association is violating 
or has violated, or the Board has reasonable cause to believe that the 
association is about to violate, a law, rule, regulation, or charter or 
other condition imposed in writing by the Board in connection with 
the granting of any application or other request by the association, or 
written agreement entered into with the Board, or is engaging or has 
engaged, or the Board has reasonable cause to believe that the associa- 
tion is about to engage, in an unsafe or unsound practice, the Board 
may issue and serve upon the association a notice of charges in respect 
thereof. The notice shall contain a statement of the facts constituting 
the alleged violation or violations or the unsafe or unsound practice or 
practices, and shall fix a time and place at which a hearing will be held 
to determine whether an order to cease and desist therefrom should 
issue against the association. Such hearing shall be fixed for a date 
not earlier than thirty days nor later than sixty days after service of 
such notice unless an earlier or a later date is set by the Board at the 
request of the association. Unless the association shall appear at the 
hearing by a duly authorized representative, it shall be deemed to have 
consented to the issuance of the cease-and-desist order. In the event of 
such consent, or if upon the record made at any such hearing the Board 
shall find that any violation or unsafe or unsound practice specified 
in the notice of charges has been established, the Board may issue and 
serve upon the association an order to cease and desist from any such 
violation or practice. Such order may, by provisions which may be 
mandatory or otherwise, require the association and its directors, offi- 
cers, employees, and agents to cease and desist from the same, and, fur- 
ther, to take affirmative action to correct the conditions resulting from 
any such violation or practice. 
"(B) A cease-and-desist order shall become effective at the expira- 
tion of thirty days after service of such order upon the association con- 
cerned (except in the case of a cease-and-desist order issued upon con- 
sent, which shall become effective at the time specified therein), and 
shall remain effective and enforceable, except to such extent as it is 
stayed, modified, terminated, or set aside by action of the Board or a 
reviewing court.
