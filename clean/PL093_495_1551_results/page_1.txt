§ 301. Short title

§ 302. Declaration of purpose
    The last sentence of section 102 of the Truth in Lending Act (15
U.S.C. 1601) is amended by striking out the period and inserting in 
lieu thereof a comma and the following: "and to protect the consumer 
against inaccurate and unfair credit billing and credit card practices."
§ 303. Definitions of creditor and open end credit plan
    The first sentence of section 103(f) of the Truth in Lending Act 
(15 U.S.C. 1602(f)) is amended to read as follows: "The term 'credi-
tor' refers only to creditors who regularly extend, or arrange for the 
extension of, credit which is payable by agreement in more than four 
installments or for which the payment of a finance charge is or may

or not the amount due is payable by agreement in more than four installments or the payment of a finance charge is or may be required,

card issuers, to the extent appropriate, even though the requirements 
are by their terms applicable only to creditors offering open end 
credit plans.

        obligor and the creditor's responsibilities under sections 162 and 
        170. With respect to each of two billing cycles per year, at semi-
        annual intervals, the creditor shall transmit such statement to each 
        obligor to whom the creditor is required to transmit a statement 
        pursuant to section 127(b) for such billing cycle."
   (b) Section 127(c) of such Act (15 U.S.C. 1637(c)) is amended to 
read:
        "(c) In the case of any existing account under an open end con-
        sumer credit plan having an outstanding balance of more than $1 at 
        or after the close of the creditor's first full billing cycle under the plan 
        after the effective date of subsection (a) or any amendments thereto, 
        the items described in subsection (a), to the extent applicable and not

        required by subsection (b)."
