Consumer Leasing Act of 1976.  
15 USC 1601 note.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE

SEC. 2. Section 102 of the Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1601) is amended by inserting "(a)" before the first sentence, and adding the following subsection:  
"(b) The Congress also finds that there has been a recent trend toward leasing automobiles and other durable goods for consumer use as an alternative to installment credit sales and that these leases have been offered without adequate cost disclosures. It is the purpose of this title to assure a meaningful disclosure of the terms of leases of personal property for personal, family, or household purposes so as to enable the lessee to compare more readily the various lease terms available to him, limit balloon payments in consumer leasing, enable comparison of lease terms with credit terms where appropriate, and to assure meaningful and accurate disclosures of lease terms in advertisements."
