of the bank, the adequacy of its capital structure, its future earnings 
prospects, the general character of its management, the convenience

this Act. 
"SEC. 7. (a) The assessment rate shall be one-twelfth of 1 per centum 
per annum. The semiannual assessment for each insured bank shall 
be in the amount of the product of one-half the annual assessment rate 
multiplied by the assessment base. The assessment base shall be the 
amount of the liability of the bank for deposits, according to the defi- 
nition of the term 'deposit' in and pursuant to subsection (1) of section 
3, without any deduction for indebtedness of depositors: Provided, 
That the bank â€” 

"(1) may deduct (i) from the deposit balance due to an insured 
bank the deposit balance due from such insured bank (other than 
trust funds deposited by it in such bank) which is subject to 
immediate withdrawal; (ii) trust funds held by the bank in a 
fiduciary capacity and which are deposited in another insured 
bank; and (iii) cash items as determined by either of the following 
methods, at the option of the bank: (aa) By multiplying by 2 
the total of the cash items forwarded for collection on the assess- 
ment base days (being the days on which the average deposits are 
computed) and cash items held for clearings at the close of business 
on said days, which are in the process of collection and which the 
bank has paid in the regular course of business or credited to 
deposit accounts; or (bb) by deducting the total of cash items for- 
warded for collection on the assessment base days and cash items 
held for clearings at the close of business on said days, which are 
in the process of collection and which the bank has paid in the 
regular course of business or credited to deposit accounts, plus 
such uncollected items paid or credited on preceding days which 
are in the process of collection: Provided, That the Board of 
Directors may define the terms 'cash items', 'process of collection', 
and 'uncollected items' and shall fix the maximum period for 
which any such item may be deducted; and 

"(2) may exclude from its assessment base (i) drafts drawn by 
it on deposit accounts in other banks which are issued in the regular 
course of business; and the amount of any advices or authoriza- 
tions, issued by it for cash letters received, directing that its deposit 
account in the sending bank be charged with the amount thereof; 
and (ii) cash funds which are received and held solely for the 
purpose of securing a liability to the bank but not in an amount 
in excess of such liability, and which are not subject to withdrawal 
by the obligor and are carried in a special non-interest-bearing 
account designated to properly show their purpose. 
Each insured bank, as a condition to the right to make any such 
deduction or exclusion in determining its assessment base, shall main- 
tain such records as will readily permit verification of the correctness 
thereof. The semiannual assessment base for one semiannual period 
shall be the average of the assessment base of the bank as of the 
close of business on March 31 and June 30, and the semiannual assess- 
ment base for the other semiannual period shall be the average of the 
assessment base of the bank as of the close of business on September
