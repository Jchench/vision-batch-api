to reserve which result in a reduction of such reserve shall be added;

losses from any preceding years in excess of such reserves. If the
above deductions exceed in amount the total assessments which become
due during the calendar year, the amount of such excess shall be
restored by deduction from total assessments becoming due in sub-
sequent years.
    (e) The Corporation (1) may refund to an insured bank any
payment of assessment in excess of the amount due to the Corporation
or (2) may credit such excess toward the payment of the assessment
next becoming due from such bank and upon succeeding assessments
until the credit is exhausted.
    (f) Any insured bank which fails to file any certified statement
required to be filed by it in connection with determining the amount of
any assessment payable by the bank to the Corporation may be com-
pelled to file such statement by mandatory injunction or other appro-
priate remedy in a suit brought for such purpose by the Corporation
against the bank and any officer or officers thereof in any court of
the United States of competent jurisdiction in the District or Terri-
tory in which such bank is located.
    (g) The Corporation, in a suit brought at law or in equity in any
court of competent jurisdiction, shall be entitled to recover from any
insured bank the amount of any unpaid assessment lawfully payable
by such insured bank to the Corporation, whether or not such bank
shall have filed any such certified statement and whether or not suit
shall have been brought to compel the bank to file any such statement.
No action or proceeding shall be brought for the recovery of any
assessment due to the Corporation, or for the recovery of any amount
paid to the Corporation in excess of the amount due to it, unless such
action or proceeding shall have been brought within five years after
the right accrued for which the claim is made, except where the
insured bank has made or filed with the Corporation a false or fraudu-

the payment of assessment, in which case the claim shall not be deemed
to have accrued until the discovery by the Corporation that the certi-

cause of action has already accrued, and the period herein prescribed
within which an action may be brought has expired, or will expire
within one year from the date this amendment becomes effective, an
action may be brought on such cause of action within one year from
the effective date of this amendment : And provided further , That no
action or proceeding shall be brought for the recovery of any assess-

base of any insured bank for any year prior to 1945 except that any
claim of the Corporation for the payment of any assessment may be
offset by it against any claim of the bank for the overpayment of any
assessment.
