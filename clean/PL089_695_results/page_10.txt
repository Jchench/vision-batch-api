entered into under section 403 of this title, the Corporation shall serve 
upon the institution a statement with respect to such violations or 
practices or conditions for the purpose of securing the correction 
thereof, and shall send a copy of such statement to the appropriate 
State supervisory authority. 
		"(2) Unless such correction shall be made within one hundred and 
twenty days after service of such statement, or such shorter period of 
not less than twenty days after such service as (A) the Corporation 
shall require in any case where the Corporation determines that its 
insurance risk with respect to such institution could be unduly jeop- 
ardized by further delay in the correction of such violations or prac- 
tices or conditions, or (B) the appropriate State supervisory authority 
shall require, or unless within such time the Corporation shall have 
received acceptable assurances that such correction will be made with- 
in a time and in a manner satisfactory to the Corporation, or in the 
event such assurances are submitted to and accepted by the Corpora- 
tion but are not carried out in accordance with their terms, the Cor- 
poration may, if it shall determine to proceed further, issue and serve 
upon the institution written notice of intention to terminate the status 
of the institution as an insured institution. 
		"(3) Such notice shall contain a statement of the facts constituting 
the alleged violation or violations or the unsafe or unsound practice 
or practices or condition, and shall fix a time and place for a hearing 
thereon. Such hearing shall be fixed for a date not earlier than thirty 
days after service of such notice. Unless the institution shall appear 
at the hearing by a duly authorized representative, it shall be deemed 
to have consented to the termination of its status as an insured insti- 
tution. In the event of such consent, or if upon the record made at any 
such hearing the Corporation shall find that any violation or unsafe 
or unsound practice or condition specified in such notice has been 
established and has not been corrected within the time above prescribed 
in which to make correction, the Corporation may issue and serve 
upon the institution an order terminating the status of the institution 
as an insured institution; but any such order shall not become effec- 
tive until it is an order which has become final (except in the case of 
an order of termination issued upon consent, which shall become effec- 
tive at the time specified therein).
	
		"(c) DATE OF TERMINATION OE INSURED STATUS.-The effective date 
of the termination of an institution’s status as an insured institution 
under the foregoing provisions of this section shall be the date specified 
for such termination in the notice by the institution to the Corpora- 
tion as provided in subsection (a) of this section, or the date upon 
which an order of termination issued under subsection (b) (3) of this 
section becomes effective. The Corporation may from time to time 
postpone the effective date of the termination of an institution’s status 
as an insured institution at any time before such termination has be- 
come effective, but in the case of termination by notice given by the 
institution such effective date shall be postponed only with the written 
consent of the institution.
		"(d) CONTINUATION OF INSURANCE; EXAMINATION; NOTICE TO MEM- 
BERS; AND PAYMENT OF PREMIUMS.-In the event of the termination of 
an institution’s status as an insured institution, insurance of its 
.accounts to the extent that they were insured on the effective date of 
.such termination as hereinabove provided in subsection (c), less any 
amounts thereafter withdrawn, repurchased, or redeemed, shall con- 
tinue for a period of two years, but no investments or deposits made 
after such date shall be insured. The Corporation shall have the right 
to examine such institution from time to time during the two-year 
.period aforesaid. Such insured institution shall be obligated to pay, 
within thirty days after the effective date of such termination, as a final
