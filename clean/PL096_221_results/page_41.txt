	 Ante, p. 171. 15 USC 1605.

“(A) resulted from an error involving the disclosure of a fee or 
charge that would otherwise be excludable in computing the 
finance charge, including but not limited to violations involving 
the disclosures described in sections 106(b), (c) and (d) of this title.
in which event the agency may require such remedial action as it 
determines to be equitable, except that for transactions consum- 
mated after two years after the effective date of section 608 of the 
Truth in Lending Simplification and Reform Act, such an adjust- 
ment shall be ordered for violations of section 106(b);
“(B) involved a disclosed amount which was 10 per centum or 
less of the amount that should have been disclosed and (i) in cases 
where the error involved a disclosed finance charge, the annual 
percentage rate was disclosed correctly, and (ii) in cases where 
the error involved a disclosed annual percentage rate, thefi- 
nance charge was disclosed correctly; in which event the agency 
may require such adjustment as it determines to be equitable;
“(C) involved a total failure to disclose either the annual 
percentage rate or the finance charge, in which event the agency 
may require such adjustment as it determines to be equitable; or
“(D) resulted from any other unique circumstance involving 
clearly technical and nonsubstantive disclosure violations that 
do not adversely affect information provided to the consumer and 
that have not misled or otherwise deceived the consumer.
In the case of other such disclosure errors, each agency may require 
such an adjustment.
 
“(3) Notwithstanding paragraph (2), no adjustment shall be ordered 
(A) if it would have a significantly adverse impact upon the safety or soundness of the creditor, but in any such case, the agency may 
require a partial adjustment in an amount which does not have such 
an impact, except that with respect to any transaction consummated
after the effective date of section 608 of the Truth in Lending 
Simplification and Reform Act, the agency shall require the full 
adjustment, but permit the creditor to make the required adjustment 
in partial payments over an extended period of time which the 
agency considers to be reasonable, (B) if the amount of the adjustment 
would be less than $1, except that if more than one year has elapsed 
since the date of the violation, the agency may require that such 
amount be paid into the Treasury of the United States, or (C) except 
where such disclosure error resulted from a willful violation which 
was intended to mislead the person to whom credit was extended, in 
the case of an open-end credit plan, more than two years after the 
violation, or in the case of any other extension of credit, as follows:
	 Ante, p. 171.

“(i) with respect to creditors that are subject to examination by 
the agencies referred to in paragraphs (1) through (3) of section 
108(a) of this title, except in connection with violations arising 
from practices identified in the current examination and only in 
connection with transactions that are consummated after the 
date of the immediately preceding examination, except that 
where practices giving rise to violations identified in earlier 
examinations have not been corrected, adjustments for those 
violations shall be required in connection with transactions 
consummated after the date of the examination in which such 
practices were first identified:

“(ii) with respect to creditors that are not subject to examina- 
tion by such agencies, except in connection with transactions 
that are consummated after May 10, 1978; and
