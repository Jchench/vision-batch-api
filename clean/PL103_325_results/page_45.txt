(4) commercial banks and other depository institutions have various incentives to minimize their risk in financing small business concerns;

(5) as a result of such incentives, many small business concerns with economically sound financing needs are unable to obtain access to needed debt capital;

(6) the small business capital access programs implemented by certain States are a flexible and efficient tool to assist financial institutions in providing access to needed debt capital for many small business concerns in a manner consistent with safety and soundness regulations;

(7) a small business capital access program would complement other programs which assist small business concerns in obtaining access to capital; and

(8) Federal policy can stimulate and accelerate efforts by States to implement small business capital access programs by providing an incentive to States, while leaving the administration of such programs to each participating State.

(1) to promote economic opportunity and growth;
(2) to create jobs;
(3) to promote economic efficiency;
