bank. Thereupon the provisions of this section applicable to member banks shall be applicable to such State bank or trust company or mutual savings bank to the same extent as if it were already a member bank: Provided, That if the application of such State bank or trust company or mutual savings bank for membership in the Federal Reserve System or for conversion into a national banking association be approved and it shall not complete its membership in the Federal Reserve System or its conversion into a national banking association within a reasonable time, or if such application shall be disapproved, then the amount paid by such State bank or trust company or mutual savings bank on account of its subscription to the capital stock of the Corporation shall be repaid to it and it shall no longer be subject to the provisions or entitled to the privileges of this section.

"(g) If any State bank or trust company, or mutual savings bank (referred to in this subsection as 'State bank') which is or which becomes a member of the Federal Reserve System is not permitted by the laws under which it was organized to purchase stock in the Corporation, it shall apply to the Corporation for admission to the benefits of this section and, if such application be granted after appropriate certification in accordance with this section, it shall deposit with the Corporation an amount equal to the amount which it would have been required to pay in on account of a subscription to capital stock of the Corporation. Thereafter such deposit shall be adjusted in the same manner as subscriptions for stock by class A stockholders. Such deposit shall be subject to the same conditions with respect to repayment as amounts paid on subscriptions to class A stock by other member banks and the Corporation shall pay interest thereon at the same rate as dividends are actually paid on outstanding shares of class A stock. As long as such deposit is maintained with the Corporation, such State bank shall, for the purposes of this section, be deemed to be a class A stockholder of the Corporation. If the laws under which such State bank was organized be amended so as to authorize State banks to subscribe for class A stock of the Corporation, such State bank shall within six months thereafter subscribe for an appropriate amount of such class A stock and the deposit hereinafter provided for in lieu of payment upon class A stock shall be applied upon such subscription. If the law under which such State bank was organized be not amended at the next session of the State legislature following the admission of such State bank to the benefits of this section so as to authorize State banks to purchase such class A stock, or, if the law be so amended and such State bank shall fail within six months thereafter to purchase such class A stock, the deposit previously made with the Corporation shall be returned to such State bank and it shall no longer be entitled to the benefits of this section, unless it shall have been closed in the meantime on account of inability to meet the demands of its depositors.

"(h) The amount of the outstanding class A stock of the Corporation held by member banks shall be annually adjusted as hereinafter provided as of the last preceding call date as member banks increase their time and demand deposits or as additional banks become members or subscribe to the stock of the Corporation, and
